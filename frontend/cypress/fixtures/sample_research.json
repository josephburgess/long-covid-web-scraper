    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. The large number of post-COVID survivors has drawn attention to the management of post-COVID condition, known as long COVID. This review examines current knowledge of long COVID, regarding its epidemiology, mechanism, and clinical presentations in both adults and children. We also review the rehabilitation principles, modules, and effects, and share Taiwan's efforts to provide a top-down, nationwide care framework for long COVID patients. Dyspnea, chronic cough, and fatigue are the most commonly reported symptoms in the first 6 months after infection, but cognitive impairment and psychological symptoms may persist beyond this time. Several possible mechanisms behind these symptoms were proposed, but remained unconfirmed. These symptoms negatively impact individuals' function, activities, participation and quality of life. Rehabilitation is a key element of management to achieve functional improvement. Early management should start with comprehensive evaluation and identification of red flags. Exercise-based therapy, an essential part of management of long COVID, can be conducted with different modules, including telerehabilitation. Post-exertional symptom exacerbation and orthostatic hypotension should be carefully monitored during exercise. Randomized control trials with a large sample size are needed to determine the optimal timing, dosage, and modules.",

    "abstract": "Introduction:Arterial Hypertension (HT) has been described as a common comorbidity and independent risk factor of short-term outcome in COVID-19 patients. However, data regarding the risk of new-onset HT during the post-acute phase of COVID-19 are scant. Aim:We assess the risk of new-onset HT in COVID-19 survivors within one year from the index infection by a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data. Methods:Data were obtained searching MEDLINE and Scopus for all studies published at any time up to February 11, 2023, and reporting the long-term risk of new-onset HT in COVID-19 survivors. Risk data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with Hazard ratio (HR) as the effect measure with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using I2statistic. Results:Overall, 19,293,346 patients (mean age 54.6 years, 54.6% males) were included in this analysis. Of them, 758,698 survived to COVID-19 infection. Over a mean follow-up of 6.8 months, new-onset HT occurred to 12.7 [95% CI 11.4-13.5] out of 1000 patients survived to COVID-19 infection compared to 8.17 [95% CI 7.34-8.53] out of 1000 control subjects. Pooled analysis revealed that recovered COVID-19 patients presented an increased risk of new-onset HT (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.46-1.97, p < 0.0001, I2= 78.9%) within seven months. This risk was directly influenced by age (p = 0.001), female sex (p = 0.03) and cancer (p < 0.0001) while an indirect association was observed using the follow-up length as moderator (p < 0.0001). Conclusions:Our findings suggest that new-onset HT represents an important post-acute COVID-19 sequelae.",

SARS-CoV-2 has been the chief source of threat to public health and safety from 2019 to the present. SARS-CoV-2 caused a sudden and significant rise in hospitalization due to respiratory issues and pneumonia. We are consistently uncovering new information about SARS-CoV-2, and yet so much is to explore to implement efficient interventions to combat the emergent variants and spread of the ongoing pandemic. Information regarding the existing COVID-19 pandemic is streamlining continuously. However, clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections spanning from asymptomatic infection to severe death-instigating disease remain consistent with preliminary reports. In this review, we have briefly introduced highlights of the COVID-19 pandemic and features of SARS-CoV-2. We have focused on current knowledge of innate and adaptive immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infections and persisting clinical features of recovered patients. Furthermore, we have discussed how these immune responses are not tightly regulated and imbalance can direct the latter phases of COVID-19, long-COVID symptoms, and cause detrimental immunopathogenesis. COVID-19 vaccines are also discussed in detail to describe the efforts going around the world to control and prevent the infection. Overall, we have summarized the current knowledge on the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the utilization of that knowledge in the development of a suitable COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines.",

Subsequently, the ability of diarylamidines to inhibit S-protein binding and various membrane serine proteases associated with SARS-CoV-2 and parasitic infections are discussed.

    "abstract": "Advanced age is one of the significant risk determinants for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related mortality and for long COVID complications. The contributing factors may include the age-related dynamical remodeling of the immune system, known as immunosenescence and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. Both of these factors may induce an inflammatory milieu in the aged brain and drive the changes in the microenvironment of neurons and microglia, which are characterized by a general condition of chronic inflammation, so-called neuroinflammation. Emerging evidence reveals that the immune privilege in the aging brain may be compromised. Resident brain cells, such as astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes and microglia, but also infiltrating immune cells, such as monocytes, T cells and macrophages participate in the complex intercellular networks and multiple reciprocal interactions. Especially changes in microglia playing a regulatory role in inflammation, contribute to disturbing of the brain homeostasis and to impairments of the neuroimmune responses. Neuroinflammation may trigger structural damage, diminish regeneration, induce neuronal cell death, modulate synaptic remodeling and in this manner negatively interfere with the brain functions.In this review article, we give insights into neuroimmune interactions in the aged brain and highlight the impact of COVID-19 on the functional systems already modulated by immunosenescence and neuroinflammation. We discuss the potential ways of these interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and review proposed neuroimmune mechanisms and biological factors that may contribute to the development of persisting long COVID conditions. We summarize the potential mechanisms responsible for long COVID, including inflammation, autoimmunity, direct virus-mediated cytotoxicity, hypercoagulation, mitochondrial failure, dysbiosis, and the reactivation of other persisting viruses, such as the Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Finally, we discuss the effects of various interventional options that can decrease the propagation of biological, physiological, and psychosocial stressors that are responsible for neuroimmune activation and which may inhibit the triggering of unbalanced inflammatory responses. We highlight the modulatory effects of bioactive nutritional compounds along with the multimodal benefits of behavioral interventions and moderate exercise, which can be applied as postinfectious interventions in order to improve brain health.",

    "abstract": "Background:Long-COVID (LC) encompasses diverse symptoms lasting months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms can be debilitating and affect the quality of life of individuals with LC and their families. Although the symptoms of LC are well described, the aetiology of LC remains unclear, and consequently, patients may be underdiagnosed. Identification of LC specific biomarkers is therefore paramount for the diagnosis and clinical management of the syndrome. This scoping review describes the molecular and cellular biomarkers that have been identified to date with potential use for diagnosis or prediction of LC. Methods:This review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Methodology for Scoping Reviews. A search was executed in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, as well as in the grey literature for original studies, published until October 5th, 2022, reporting biomarkers identified in participants with LC symptoms (from all ages, ethnicities, and sex), with a previous infection of SARS-CoV-2. Non-English studies, cross-sectional studies, studies without a control group, and pre-prints were excluded. Two reviewers independently evaluated the studies, extracted population data and associated biomarkers. Findings:23 cohort studies were identified, involving 2163 LC patients [median age 51.8 years, predominantly female sex (61.10%), white (75%), and non-vaccinated (99%)]. A total of 239 candidate biomarkers were identified, consisting mainly of immune cells, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and other plasma proteins. 19 of the 239 candidate biomarkers identified were evaluated by the authors, by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Interpretation:Diverse cellular and molecular biomarkers for LC have been proposed. Validation of candidate biomarkers in independent samples should be prioritized. Modest reported performance (particularly in larger studies) suggests LC may encompass many distinct aetiologies, which should be explored e.g., by stratifying by symptom clusters and/or sex. Funding:Dr. Tebbutt has received funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (177747) to conduct this work. The funding source was not involved in this scoping review, or in the decision to submit this manuscript for publication.",

Suspected long-term cardiovascular complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection may present as a constellation of symptoms that can be challenging for clinicians to diagnose and treat.

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammatory disorders preferentially impair the higher cognitive and executive functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This includes such challenging disorders as delirium, perioperative neurocognitive disorder, and the sustained cognitive deficits from \"long-COVID\" or traumatic brain injury. There are no FDA-approved treatments for these symptoms; thus, understanding their etiology is important for generating therapeutic strategies. The current review describes the molecular rationale for why PFC circuits are especially vulnerable to inflammation, and how α2A-adrenoceptor (α2A-AR) actions throughout the nervous and immune systems can benefit the circuits in PFC needed for higher cognition. The layer III circuits in the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) that generate and sustain the mental representations needed for higher cognition have unusual neurotransmission and neuromodulation. They are wholly dependent on NMDAR neurotransmission, with little AMPAR contribution, and thus are especially vulnerable to kynurenic acid inflammatory signaling which blocks NMDAR. Layer III dlPFC spines also have unusual neuromodulation, with cAMP magnification of calcium signaling in spines, which opens nearby potassium channels to rapidly weaken connectivity and reduce neuronal firing. This process must be tightly regulated, e.g. by mGluR3 or α2A-AR on spines, to prevent loss of firing. However, the production of GCPII inflammatory signaling reduces mGluR3 actions and markedly diminishes dlPFC network firing. Both basic and clinical studies show that α2A-AR agonists such as guanfacine can restore dlPFC network firing and cognitive function, through direct actions in the dlPFC, but also by reducing the activity of stress-related circuits, e.g. in the locus coeruleus and amygdala, and by having anti-inflammatory actions in the immune system. This information is particularly timely, as guanfacine is currently the focus of large clinical trials for the treatment of delirium, and in open label studies for the treatment of cognitive deficits from long-COVID.",

Self-reported questionnaires on fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS), sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI) showed higher scores for LC (4.79 ± 0.12, 7.45 ± 0.33 and 7.46 ± 0.27, respectively) than NS patients (2.85 ± 0.16, 5.23 ± 0.32 and 4.26 ± 0.29, respectively; p < 0.05 for all vs. LC). By comparing data of the three waves, mean FSS and PSQI scores of LC patients, but not ESS scores, exceeded the normal range in all, with no significant inter-wave differences. Considering FSS ≥ 4 and PSQI > 5 cutoff values, LC patients commonly exhibited problematic fatigue (≥ 70%) and poor sleep quality (> 60%) in all three waves. Comparative analysis of PSQI component scores of LC patients identified no significant differences between the three waves. Our findings highlight the importance of concerted efforts to manage both fatigue and sleep disturbances in long COVID patient care. This multifaceted approach should be followed in all cases infected with either VOCs of SARS-CoV-2.",

The hypercoagulable state is due in part to immune system dysregulation, inflammation and endothelial cell damage, as well as a reduction in defense systems. One defense mechanism in particular is glutathione (GSH), a ubiquitously found antioxidant. Evidence suggests that reduction in GSH increases viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and thrombosis, as well as decreases macrophage-mediated fibrin removal. The collection of adverse effects as a result of GSH depletion in states like COVID-19 suggest that GSH depletion is a dominant mechanism of immunothrombosis cascade.

The aim of this article was to overview data on the pathobiology of Long COVID in patients with RDs. Related risk factors, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of Long COVID in RDs were analyzed. Relevant articles were retrieved from Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Diverse mechanisms of viral persistence, chronic low-grade inflammation, lasting production of autoantibodies, endotheliopathy, vascular complications, and permanent tissue damage have been described in association with Long COVID.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused havoc all around the world. The causative agent of COVID-19 is the novel form of the coronavirus (CoV) named SARS-CoV-2, which results in immune system disruption, increased inflammation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). T cells have been important components of the immune system, which decide the fate of the COVID-19 disease. Recent studies have reported an important subset of T cells known as regulatory T cells (Tregs), which possess immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties and play a crucial role in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease. Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 patients have considerably fewer Tregs than the general population. Such a decrement may have an impact on COVID-19 patients in a number of ways, including diminishing the effect of inflammatory inhibition, creating an inequality in the Treg/Th17 percentage, and raising the chance of respiratory failure. Having fewer Tregs may enhance the likelihood of long COVID development in addition to contributing to the disease's poor prognosis. Additionally, tissue-resident Tregs provide tissue repair in addition to immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory activities, which may aid in the recovery of COVID-19 patients. The severity of the illness is also linked to abnormalities in the Tregs' phenotype, such as reduced expression of FoxP3 and other immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and TGF-beta. Hence, in this review, we summarize the immunosuppressive mechanisms and their possible roles in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, the perturbations in Tregs have been associated with disease severity. The roles of Tregs are also explained in the long COVID. This review also discusses the potential therapeutic roles of Tregs in the management of patients with COVID-19.",

The effects range from service disruption including ambulatory clinic closure due to both patient and provider concerns, to lack of capacity in hospital services. In rheumatology, there were other effects including viral infection-related autoantibody production, concerns about the use of systemic immunosuppression in the presence of an infectious pandemic and even concerns for viral infection-induced flares of rheumatic disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to the rapid adoption of innovative technologies that permitted the introduction and increased use of telemedicine via a number of platforms. Rapid discoveries and innovations led to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents in the management of COVID-19. Scientific advancement and discoveries around COVID-19 infection, symptoms, autoantibody production, chronic sequela and the repurposing of rheumatic immunosuppressive agents led to improved survival and an expanded role for the rheumatologist. Rheumatologists may sometimes be involved in the diagnosis and management of the hospitalized COVID-19 patient. In the ambulatory clinic, a rheumatologist also helps to differentiate between symptoms of long COVID and those of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD). Rheumatologists must also grapple with the concerns related to immunosuppressive therapy and the risk of COVID-19 infections. In addition, there are concerns around vaccine effectiveness in people with SARD and those on immunosuppressive medications. Although the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the effects on healthcare resulted in difficulties, both patients and providers have risen to the challenge. The long-term outcome of COVID-19 for the medical system and rheumatologists in particular is not yet fully understood and will need further study. This review concentrates on the changing role of the rheumatologists, improved understanding of rheumatic disease and immunosuppressive therapies in the wake of the pandemic and how this has led to an improvement in the care of patients with COVID-19.",

Alteration of DA levels is central in Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor manifestations and deposition of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates. Previous studies have hypothesized a link between PD and viral infections. Indeed, different cases of parkinsonism have been reported following COVID-19. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a neurodegenerative process is still a matter of debate. Interestingly, evidence of brain inflammation has been described in postmortem samples of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, which suggests immune-mediated mechanisms triggering the neurological sequelae. In this review, we discuss the role of proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and oxygen reactive species in modulating DA homeostasis. Moreover, we review the existing literature on the possible mechanistic interplay between SARS-CoV-2-mediated neuroinflammation and nigrostriatal DAergic impairment, and the cross-talk with aberrant α-syn metabolism.",

The susceptibility factors discussed here are both genetic and environmental although not well understood. While the dysfunctional physiology in ME/CFS is becoming clearer, understanding has been hampered by different combinations of symptoms in each affected person. A common core set of mainly neurological symptoms forms the modern clinical case definition, in the absence of an accessible molecular diagnostic test. This landscape has prompted interest in whether ME/CFS patients can be classified into a particular phenotype/subtype that might assist better management of their illness and suggest preferred therapeutic options. Currently, the same promising drugs, nutraceuticals, or behavioral therapies available can be beneficial, have no effect, or be detrimental to each individual patient. We have shown that individuals with the same disease profile exhibit unique molecular changes and physiological responses to stress, exercise and even vaccination. Key features of ME/CFS discussed here are the possible mechanisms determining the shift of an immune/inflammatory response from transient to chronic in ME/CFS, and how the brain and CNS manifests the neurological symptoms, likely with activation of its specific immune system and resulting neuroinflammation. The many cases of the post viral ME/CFS-like condition, Long COVID, following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the intense research interest and investment in understanding this condition, provide exciting opportunities for the development of new therapeutics that will benefit ME/CFS patients.",

The novelty is that it is protein based infectious agent not involving a nucleic acid genome as found in viruses and bacteria. Prion disorders exhibit, in part, incubation periods, neuronal loss, and induce abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins due to enhancing reactive oxygen species associated with mitochondria energy metabolism. These agents may also induce memory, personality and movement abnormalities as well as depression, confusion and disorientation. Interestingly, some of these behavioral changes also occur in COVID-19 and mechanistically include mitochondrial damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 and subsequenct production of reactive oxygen species. Taken together, we surmise, in part, long COVID may involve the induction of spontaneous prion emergence, especially in individuals susceptible to its origin may thus explain some of its manesfestions post-acute viral infection.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in human health and disease. Gut dysbiosis is known to be associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory diseases and modifications in the immune response and homeostasis of the lungs (the so-called gut-lung axis). Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the possible role of dysbiosis in neurological disturbances, introducing the notion of the \"gut-brain axis.\" During the last 2 years, several studies have described the presence of gut dysbiosis during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its relationship with disease severity, SARS-CoV-2 gastrointestinal replication, and immune inflammation. Moreover, the possible persistence of gut dysbiosis after disease resolution may be linked to long-COVID syndrome and particularly to its neurological manifestations. We reviewed recent evidence on the association between dysbiosis and COVID-19, investigating the possible epidemiologic confounding factors like age, location, sex, sample size, the severity of disease, comorbidities, therapy, and vaccination status on gut and airway microbial dysbiosis in selected studies on both COVID-19 and long-COVID. Moreover, we analyzed the confounding factors strictly related to microbiota, specifically diet investigation and previous use of antibiotics/probiotics, and the methodology used to study the microbiota (α- and β-diversity parameters and relative abundance tools). Of note, only a few studies focused on longitudinal analyses, especially for long-term observation in long-COVID. Lastly, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the role of microbiota transplantation and other therapeutic approaches and their possible impact on disease progression and severity. Preliminary data seem to suggest that gut and airway dysbiosis might play a role in COVID-19 and in long-COVID neurological symptoms. Indeed, the development and interpretation of these data could have important implications for future preventive and therapeutic strategies.",

The National Institutes of Health is currently funding large multi-center research programs as part of its Researching COVID to Enhance Recover (RECOVER) initiative to understand why some individuals do not recover fully from COVID-19. Several ongoing pathobiology studies have provided clues to potential mechanisms contributing to this condition. These include persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and/or genetic material, immune dysregulation, reactivation of other latent viral infections, microvascular dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis, among others. Although our understanding of the causes of long COVID remains incomplete, these early pathophysiologic studies suggest biological pathways that could be targeted in therapeutic trials that aim to ameliorate symptoms. Repurposed medicines and novel therapeutics deserve formal testing in clinical trial settings prior to adoption. While we endorse clinical trials, especially those that prioritize inclusion of the diverse populations most affected by COVID-19 and long COVID, we discourage off-label experimentation in uncontrolled and/or unsupervised settings.

    "abstract": "The previous acute respiratory diseases caused by viruses originating from China or the middle east (e.g., SARS, MERS) remained fast developing short diseases without major sequalae or any long-lasting complications. The new COVID-19, on the other hand, not only that it rapidly spread over the world, but some patients never fully recovered or even if they did, a few weeks later started to complain not only of shortness of breath, if any, but general weakness, muscle pains and 'brain fog', i.e., fuzzy memories. Thus, these signs and symptoms were eventually labelled 'long COVID', for which the most widely used definition is 'new signs and symptoms occurring 4-8 weeks after recovering from acute stage of COVID-19'. The other most frequent manifestations associated with long COVID include headache, loss of memory, smell and of hair, nausea, and vomiting. Thus, long COVID is not a simple disease, but complex disorder of several organ systems malfunctioning; hence, it is probably more appropriate to call this a syndrome. The pathogenesis of long COVID syndrome is poorly understood, but initial and persistent vascular endothelial injury that often triggers the formation of microthrombi that if dislodged as emboli, damage several organs, especially in the brain, heart and kidney, by creating microinfarcts. The other major contributory mechanistic factor is the persistent cytokine storm that may last longer in long COVID patients than in others, probably triggered by aggregates of SARS-Co-2 discovered recently in the adrenal cortex, kidney and brain. The prevalence of long COVID is relatively high, e.g., initially varied 3-30%, and recent data indicate that 2.5% of UK population suffers from this syndrome, while in the US 14.7% of acute COVID-19 patients continued to have symptoms longer than 2 months. Thus, the long COVID syndrome deserves to be further investigated, both from clinical and basic research perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic physiology plays a key role in maintaining our health and resilience. Metabolic disorders can lead to serious illnesses, including obesity. The pathogenesis of the new long COVID syndrome in individuals with long-term recovery after SARS-Co-2 infection is still incomplete. Thus there is growing attention in the study of adipose tissue activities, especially brown adipose tissue (BAT) and associated resilience which plays a crucial role in different types of obesity as potential targets for pharmacologic and nutritional interventions in the context of obesity and long COVID. The number of studies examining mechanisms underlying BAT has grown rapidly in the last 10 years despite of role of BAT in individuals with COVID-19 and long COVID is modest. Therefore, this review aims to sum up data examining BAT activities, its resilience in health, obesity, and the possible link to long COVID. The search was conducted on studies published in English mostly between 2004 and 2022 in adult humans and animal models. Database searches were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for key terms including adipose tissue, BAT, adipokines, obesity, VPF/VEGF, and pathogenesis. From the initial search through the database were identified relevant articles that met inclusion and exclusion criteria and our data regarding adipose tissues were presented in this review. It will discuss adiposity tissue activities. Current literature suggests that there are BAT integral effects to whitening and browning fat phenomena which reflect the homeostatic metabolic adaptive ability for environmental demand or survival/adaptive mechanisms. We also review neural and vascular impacts in BAT that play a role in resilience and obesity. Finally, we discuss the role of BAT in the context of long COVID in basic research and clinical research.",

    "abstract": "ME/CFS is a debilitating chronic condition that often develops after viral or bacterial infection. Insight from the study of Long COVID/Post Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), the post-viral syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, might prove to be useful for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms of ME/CFS. Disease presentation is similar between the two conditions, and a subset of Long COVID patients meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. Since Long COVID is characterized by significant vascular pathology - including endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and vascular dysregulation - the question of whether or not the same biological abnormalities are of significance in ME/CFS arises. Cardiac abnormalities have for a while now been documented in ME/CFS cohorts, with recent studies demonstrating major deficits in cerebral blood flow, and hence vascular dysregulation. A growing body of research is demonstrating that ME/CFS is accompanied by platelet hyperactivation, anomalous clotting, a procoagulant phenotype, and endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial damage and dysregulated clotting can impair substance exchange between blood and tissues, and result in hypoperfusion, which may contribute to the manifestation of certain ME/CFS symptoms. Here we review the ME/CFS literature to summarize cardiovascular and haematological findings documented in patients with the condition, and, in this context, briefly discuss the potential role of previously-implicated pathogens. Overall, cardiac and haematological abnormalities are present within ME/CFS cohorts. While atherosclerotic heart disease is not significantly associated with ME/CFS, suboptimal cardiovascular function defined by reduced cardiac output, impaired cerebral blood flow, and vascular dysregulation are, and these abnormalities do not appear to be influenced by deconditioning. Rather, these cardiac abnormalities may result from dysfunction in the (autonomic) nervous system. Plenty of recently published studies are demonstrating significant platelet hyperactivity and endothelial dysfunction in ME/CFS, as well as anomalous clotting processes. It is of particular importance to determine to what extent these cardiovascular and haematological abnormalities contribute to symptom severity, and if these two systems can be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Viral reservoirs of herpesviruses exist in ME/CFS, and most likely contribute to cardiovascular and haematological dysfunction directly or indirectly. This review highlights the potential of studying cardiac functioning, the vasculature, and coagulation system in ME/CFS.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve blocks are becoming increasingly used as adjunctive treatment modalities for a variety of conditions refractory to medical management. Right or left stellate ganglion blocks (SGB) are a specific type of peripheral nerve block that target the sympathetic blockade of neuronal impulses using the injection of local anesthetic and steroids into nerve bundles in the cervical area. This review article is intended to summarize the common uses of stellate ganglion blocks and explain the procedural technique, which has evolved with technological advances in ultrasonography. The similarities between these disease processes are centered around sympathetic hyperactivity. This sympathetic overdrive state is created by increased levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), which causes a cascade of sympathetic sprouting resulting in increased norepinephrine (NE) systemically. Reversal of this cascade by local anesthetic injection into the stellate ganglion thereby reduces NGF and sympathetic sprouting subsequently lowering overall norepinephrine levels. This is the unifying theory by which SGB is able to provide resolution for the varied clinical conditions described in this article. This review article discusses the physiology of several conditions where stellate ganglion blocks are being investigated as an adjunct treatment modality, including anosmia, PTSD, long-COVID, chronic fatigue syndrome, menopausal hot flashes, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Overall, the current literature supporting the use of stellate ganglion blocks for several esoteric conditions is limited; however, case reports to date have shown promising evidence-based results supporting their use as an adjunctive treatment among patients with refractory symptoms to existing treatment algorithms. In conclusion, SGB should be considered among patients with refractory symptoms for medical management in the conditions discussed in this article. Further research is needed to delineate which patients will benefit from the use of SGB, the use of subsequent blocks and timelines in between injections, and unilateral versus bilateral blockade.",

Physiology-centered risks related to age, gender, body mass index (BMI), marital status and educational capacity, smoking, lifestyle, physical activity, and laboratory findings (before disease), and symptom distribution were analyzed. Results:The cohort for the study consisted of 166 females and 107 males (mean age = 42; including young 18 (5.4%) and middle- and old-aged adults 314 (96.4%)). Increased BMI was in 61%, and less physical activity-65%. There were 4 clusters of symptoms related to physical, neurocognitive, pulmonary, and pain conditions. 95% of participants had ≥ 3 symptoms.

Digital interventions can meet these requirements, especially if personal contact is limited. Objective:We reviewed evidence-based digital interventions that are currently available to help manage physical and mental health in patients with post-COVID/long-COVID symptoms. Methods:A scoping review was carried out summarizing novel digital health interventions for treating post-COVID/long-COVID patients. Using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) scheme, original studies were summarized, in which patients with post-COVID/long-COVID symptoms used digital interventions to help aid recovery. Results:From all scanned articles, 8 original studies matched the inclusion criteria. Of the 8 studies, 3 were \"pretest\" studies, 3 described the implementation of a telerehabilitation program, 1 was a post-COVID/long-COVID program, and 1 described the results of qualitative interviews with patients who used an online peer-support group. Following the PICO scheme, we summarized previous studies. Studies varied in terms of participants (P), ranging from adults in different countries, such as former hospitalized patients with COVID-19, to individuals in disadvantaged communities in the United Kingdom, as well as health care workers. In addition, the studies included patients who had previously been infected with COVID-19 and who had ongoing symptoms. Some studies focused on individuals with specific symptoms, including those with either post-COVID-19 or long-term symptoms, while other studies included patients based on participation in online peer-support groups. The interventions (I) also varied. Most interventions used a combination of psychological and physical exercises, but they varied in duration, frequency, and social dimensions. The reviewed studies investigated the physical and mental health conditions of patients with post-COVID/long-COVID symptoms. Most studies had no control (C) group, and most studies reported outcomes (O) or improvements in physiological health perception, some physical conditions, fatigue, and some psychological aspects such as depression. However, some studies found no improvements in bowel or bladder problems, concentration, short-term memory, unpleasant dreams, physical ailments, perceived bodily pain, emotional ailments, and perceived mental health. Conclusions:More systematic research with larger sample sizes is required to overcome sampling bias and include health care professionals' perspectives, as well as help patients mobilize support from health care professionals and social network partners. The evidence so far suggests that patients should be provided with digital interventions to manage symptoms and reintegrate into everyday life, including work.",

    "abstract": "Objective:To determine the effect of covid-19 vaccination, given before and after acute infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or after a diagnosis of long covid, on the rates and symptoms of long covid. Design:Systematic review. Data sources:PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane covid-19 trials, and Europe PubMed Central (Europe PMC) for preprints, from 1 January 2020 to 3 August 2022. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies:Trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies reporting on patients with long covid and symptoms of long covid, with vaccination before and after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or after a diagnosis of long covid. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool. Results:1645 articles were screened but no randomised controlled trials were found. 16 observational studies from five countries (USA, UK, France, Italy, and the Netherlands) were identified that reported on 614 392 patients. The most common symptoms of long covid that were studied were fatigue, cough, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, loss of taste, headache, muscle ache, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating, worry or anxiety, and memory loss or confusion. 12 studies reported data on vaccination before infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and 10 showed a significant reduction in the incidence of long covid: the odds ratio of developing long covid with one dose of vaccine ranged from 0.22 to 1.03; with two doses, odds ratios were 0.25-1; with three doses, 0.16; and with any dose, 0.48-1.01. Five studies reported on vaccination after infection, with odds ratios of 0.38-0.91. The high heterogeneity between studies precluded any meaningful meta-analysis. The studies failed to adjust for potential confounders, such as other protective behaviours and missing data, thus increasing the risk of bias and decreasing the certainty of evidence to low. Conclusions:Current studies suggest that covid-19 vaccines might have protective and therapeutic effects on long covid. More robust comparative observational studies and trials are needed, however, to clearly determine the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing and treating long covid.

The goal of this study was to compile all the data that was currently available to evaluate COVID-19's long-term effects at 12 months and above. We looked for studies published by December 15, 2022, in PubMed and Embase that discussed follow-up findings for COVID-19 survivors who had been alive for at least a year. A random-effect model was carried out to determine the combined prevalence of different long-COVID symptoms. The Joanna Briggs Institute tool was used to assess the risk of bias for the included studies, and the I2 statistics were used to evaluate the heterogeneity. After reviewing 3,209 studies, 46 were deemed admissible, with an aggregate COVID-19 population of 17976. At 12 months and above, 57% of patients reported a minimum of one symptom, and the five most prevalent symptoms were: dyspnea on exertion (34%, 95% CI 0.2; 0.94); difficulty in concentration (32%, 95% CI 0.16; 0.52); fatigue (31%, 95% CI 0.22; 0.40); frailty (31%, 95% CI 0.06; 0.78); and arthromyalgia (28%, 95% CI 0.09; 0.6). The findings of the present study showed that at 12 months and beyond, a sizable fraction of COVID-19 survivors still have lasting symptoms that impair several body systems. Long-COVID patients require an urgent understanding of pathophysiological processes and the development of tailored treatments.",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to establish the prevalence of COVID-19-related BES and COVID-19-related BMS and describe their phenomenology. Methodology:A literature search in the PubMed database was performed, and seven papers (five on BES and two on BMS) were eligible to be included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Results:The pooled prevalence of COVID-19-related BES was 9.9% (95% CI 3.4-25.4%). The frequency of COVID-19-related BMS is only reported in isolated cases and ranges from 4% in mild-to-moderate cases to 15% in severe, hospitalized cases, with female patients being mostly affected. COVID-19 severity is a potential risk factor for both BES and BMS. Neither syndrome occurs in isolation. COVID-19-related BES usually appears within the first week post-infection, persisting up to 9 weeks later. COVID-19-related BMS occurs during and after initial infection, and may also persist as a chronic disease. Conclusions:Both BES and BMS are neuropathic COVID-19 infection complications, still under-studied and under-investigated, despite the fact that both are prevalent. Both COVID-19-related BES and COVID-19-related BMS could potentially be initial long COVID syndrome manifestations, and further research should be carried out in this field.",

    "abstract": "The development of long-term symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more than four weeks after primary infection, termed \"long COVID\" or post-acute sequela of COVID-19 (PASC), can implicate persistent neurological complications in up to one third of patients and present as fatigue, \"brain fog\", headaches, cognitive impairment, dysautonomia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, anosmia, hypogeusia, and peripheral neuropathy. Pathogenic mechanisms of these symptoms of long COVID remain largely unclear; however, several hypotheses implicate both nervous system and systemic pathogenic mechanisms such as SARS-CoV2 viral persistence and neuroinvasion, abnormal immunological response, autoimmunity, coagulopathies, and endotheliopathy. Outside of the CNS, SARS-CoV-2 can invade the support and stem cells of the olfactory epithelium leading to persistent alterations to olfactory function. SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce abnormalities in innate and adaptive immunity including monocyte expansion, T-cell exhaustion, and prolonged cytokine release, which may cause neuroinflammatory responses and microglia activation, white matter abnormalities, and microvascular changes. Additionally, microvascular clot formation can occlude capillaries and endotheliopathy, due to SARS-CoV-2 protease activity and complement activation, can contribute to hypoxic neuronal injury and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, respectively. Current therapeutics target pathological mechanisms by employing antivirals, decreasing inflammation, and promoting olfactory epithelium regeneration. Thus, from laboratory evidence and clinical trials in the literature, we sought to synthesize the pathophysiological pathways underlying neurological symptoms of long COVID and potential therapeutics.",

The prevalence of post-COVID sequelae in children is highly variable among studies, with an average of 25%. The sequelae may affect many organ systems, though mood symptoms, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, and sleep problems are common. In many studies, it is difficult to establish a causal association due to the lack of a control group. Furthermore, it is difficult to differentiate whether the neuropsychiatric symptoms in children after COVID-19 are due to infection or a result of lockdowns and social restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Children with COVID-19 should be followed by a multidisciplinary team and screened for symptoms, followed by focused laboratory evaluations as needed. There is no specific treatment for the sequelae.

Although most infections cause a self-limited syndrome comparable to other upper respiratory viral pathogens, a portion of individuals develop severe illness leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, an estimated 10%-20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are followed by post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), or long COVID. Long COVID is associated with a wide variety of clinical manifestations including cardiopulmonary complications, persistent fatigue, and neurocognitive dysfunction. Severe acute COVID-19 is associated with hyperactivation and increased inflammation, which may be an underlying cause of long COVID in a subset of individuals. However, the immunologic mechanisms driving long COVID development are still under investigation. Early in the pandemic, our group and others observed immune dysregulation persisted into convalescence after acute COVID-19. We subsequently observed persistent immune dysregulation in a cohort of individuals experiencing long COVID. We demonstrated increased SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T-cell responses and antibody affinity in patients experiencing long COVID symptoms. These data suggest a portion of long COVID symptoms may be due to chronic immune activation and the presence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 antigen. This review summarizes the COVID-19 literature to date detailing acute COVID-19 and convalescence and how these observations relate to the development of long COVID. In addition, we discuss recent findings in support of persistent antigen and the evidence that this phenomenon contributes to local and systemic inflammation and the heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations seen in long COVID.",

    "abstract": "Background:Post-acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms occurred in most of the COVID-19 survivors. However, few studies have examined the issue of whether hospitalization results in different post-acute COVID-19 symptom risks. This study aimed to compare potential COVID-19 long-term effects in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 survivors. Methods:This study is designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. A systematic search of six databases was performed for identifying articles published from inception until April 20th, 2022, which compared post-acute COVID-19 symptom risk in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 survivors using a predesigned search strategy included terms for SARS-CoV-2 (eg,COVID, coronavirus, and2019-nCoV), post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome (eg,post-COVID, post COVID conditions, chronic COVID symptom, long COVID, long COVID symptom, long-haul COVID, COVID sequelae, convalescence, andpersistent COVID symptom), and hospitalization (hospitalized, in hospital, andhome-isolated). The present meta-analysis was conducted according to The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement using R software 4.1.3 to create forest plots. Q statistics and theI2index were used to evaluate heterogeneity in this meta-analysis. Results:Six observational studies conducted in Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Canada, and the USA involving 419 hospitalized and 742 non-hospitalized COVID-19 survivors were included. The number of COVID-19 survivors in included studies ranged from 63 to 431, and follow-up data were collected through visits in four studies and another two used an electronic questionnaire, visit and telephone, respectively. Significant increase in the risks of long dyspnea (OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.90-5.32), anxiety (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.47-6.47), myalgia (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.02-5.33), and hair loss (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.07-7.12) risk were found in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors compared with outpatients. Conversely, persisting ageusia risk was significantly reduced in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors than in non-hospitalized patients. Conclusion:The findings suggested that special attention and patient-centered rehabilitation service based on a needs survey should be provided for hospitalized COVID-19 survivors who experienced high post-acute COVID-19 symptoms risk.",

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 2019 was also marked mainly by its symptoms of respiratory illness, which were named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its initial discovery, many other symptoms have been linked to acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections as well as to the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Among these symptoms are different categories of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which continue to be the main cause of death worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 17.9 million people die from CVDs each year, accounting for 32% of all deaths globally. Physical inactivity is one of the most important behavioral risk factors for CVDs. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected CVDs as well as the physical activity in different ways.

Background:Qualitative research on long COVID by subtype has not yet occurred. As pulmonary sequelae constitute a serious long COVID subtype, exploring patient experience and needs can generate knowledge to guide nursing practice. Design:Systematised review methodology utilised on a purposive sample of published articles and reported using the PRISMA guidelines and checklists. Searched MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and Google Scholar, for English or French articles published from February 2020 to June 2022; qualitative research with adults recovering from COVID-19 with evidence of pulmonary sequelae. Methods:Established principles for data extraction followed related to data reduction, data presentation, data comparison, and conclusion formulation and verification. Analysis was informed by Thorne's Interpretive Description and extended with Meleis' transitions theory, Mishel's uncertainty in illness theory and Moore et al.'s holistic theory of unpleasant symptoms. The quality of included studies was assessed Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for qualitative research. Results:Four articles with six pooled participants provided data to yield three main themes: (1) a novel health-illness transition, (2) lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis as antecedent to illness uncertainty, (3) and pulmonary symptoms that are compounded by fatigue and weakness. Conclusion:Pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 confers a unique health-illness transition, uncertainties and symptoms that can be addressed by theory informed nursing practice. Relevance to clinical practice:Advocacy, optimising the nurse-patient relationship, offering up-to-date information and addressing uncertainty may help patients cope with pulmonary sequelae, a complex subtype of long COVID with important considerations for clinical nursing care. Despite a lack of evidence-informed clinical pathways, nurses can support patients to understand novel treatments, support discharge planning and acknowledge the synergistic nature of pulmonary symptoms and fatigue to support health-illness transitions.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported in 2019, causing massive morbidity and mortality. The majority of the COVID-19 patients survived and developed Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PC19S) of varying severity. Currently, the diagnosis of PC19S is achieved through history and symptomatology that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. However, the heavy reliance on subjective reporting is prone to reporting errors. Besides, there is no unified diagnostic assessment tool to classify the clinical severity of patients. This leads to significant difficulties when managing patients in terms of public resource utilization, clinical progression monitorization and rehabilitation plan formulation. This narrative review aims to review current evidence of diagnosis based on triple assessment: clinical symptomatology, biochemical analysis and imaging evidence. Further assessment tools can be developed based on triple assessment to monitor patient's clinical progression, prognosis and intervals of monitoring. It also highlights the high-risk features of patients for closer and earlier monitoring. Rehabilitation programs and related clinical trials are evaluated; however, most of them focus on cardiorespiratory fitness and psychiatric presentations such as anxiety and depression. Further research is required to establish an objective and comprehensive assessment tool to facilitate clinical management and rehabilitation plans.",

This disorder is characterized by a wide range of persisting, returning or even new but related symptoms that involve different tissues and organs, including respiratory, cardiac, vascular, gastrointestinal, musculo-skeletal, neurological, endocrine and systemic. Some overlapping symptomatologies exist between long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Very much like with long ME/CFS, infections with herpes family viruses, immune dysregulation, and the persistence of inflammation have been reported as the most common pattern for the development of long COVID. This review describes several factors and determinants of long COVID that have been proposed, elaborating mainly on viral persistence, reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 6 which are also associated with the pathology of ME/CFS, viral superantigen activation of the immune system, disturbance in the gut microbiome, and multiple tissue damage and autoimmunity. Based on these factors, we propose diagnostic strategies such as the measurement of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, EBV, HHV-6, viral superantigens, gut microbiota, and biomarkers of autoimmunity to better understand and manage this multi-factorial disorder that continues to affect millions of people in the world.",

Patients diagnosed with PCS develop an extended range of persistent symptoms and/or complications from COVID-19. The risk factors and clinical manifestations are many and various. Advanced age, sex/gender, and pre-existing conditions certainly influence the pathogenesis and course of this syndrome. However, the absence of precise diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers may further complicate the clinical management of patients. This review aimed to summarize recent evidence on the factors influencing PCS, possible biomarkers, and therapeutic approaches. Older patients recovered approximately one month earlier than younger patients, with higher rates of symptoms. Fatigue during the acute phase of COVID-19 appears to be an important risk factor for symptom persistence. Female sex, older age, and active smoking are associated with a higher risk of developing PCS. The incidence of cognitive decline and the risk of death are higher in PCS patients than in controls. Complementary and alternative medicine appears to be associated with improvement in symptoms, particularly fatigue. The heterogeneous nature of post-COVID symptoms and the complexity of patients with PCS, who are often polytreated due to concomitant clinical conditions, suggest a holistic and integrated approach to provide useful guidance for the treatment and overall management of long COVID.",

In this systematic review, we provide an overview of lung imaging and its findings in long COVID patients. A PubMed search was performed on 29 September 2021, for English language studies in which lung imaging was performed in adults suffering from long COVID. Two independent researchers extracted the data. Our search identified 3130 articles, of which 31, representing the imaging findings of 342 long COVID patients, were retained. The most common imaging modality used was computed tomography (CT) (N = 249). A total of 29 different imaging findings were reported, which were broadly categorized into interstitial (fibrotic), pleural, airway, and other parenchymal abnormalities. A direct comparison between cases, in terms of residual lesions, was available for 148 patients, of whom 66 (44.6%) had normal CT findings. Although respiratory symptoms belong to the most common symptoms in long COVID patients, this is not necessarily linked to radiologically detectable lung damage. Therefore, more research is needed on the role of the various types of lung (and other organ) damage which may or may not occur in long COVID.",
    "summary": "Long COVID is the persistence of one or more COVID-19 symptoms after the initial viral infection, and there is evidence supporting its association with lung damage. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of lung imaging and its findings in long COVID patients. A PubMed search was performed on 29 September 2021, for English language studies in which lung imaging was performed in adults suffering from long COVID. Two independent researchers extracted the data. A direct comparison between cases, in terms of residual lesions, was available for 148 patients, of whom 66 (44.6%) had normal CT findings.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the animal kingdom, our two chemical senses, olfaction and gustation, are defined by two primary factors: genomic architecture of the organisms and their living environment. During the past three years of the global COVID-19 pandemic, these two sensory modalities have drawn much attention at the basic science and clinical levels because of the strong association of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction with viral infection. Loss of our sense of smell alone, or together with a loss of taste, has emerged as a reliable indicator of COVID-19 infection. Previously, similar dysfunctions have been detected in a large cohort of patients with chronic conditions. The research focus remains on understanding the persistence of olfactory and gustatory disturbances in the post-infection phase, especially in cases with long-term effect of infection (long COVID). Also, both sensory modalities show consistent age-related decline in studies aimed to understand the pathology of neurodegenerative conditions. Some studies using classical model organisms show an impact on neural structure and behavior in offspring as an outcome of parental olfactory experience. The methylation status of specific odorant receptors, activated in parents, is passed on to the offspring. Furthermore, experimental evidence indicates an inverse correlation of gustatory and olfactory abilities with obesity. Such diverse lines of evidence emerging from basic and clinical research studies indicate a complex interplay of genetic factors, evolutionary forces, and epigenetic alterations. Environmental factors that regulate gustation and olfaction could induce epigenetic modulation. However, in turn, such modulation leads to variable effects depending on genetic makeup and physiological status. Therefore, a layered regulatory hierarchy remains active and is passed on to multiple generations. In the present review, we attempt to understand the experimental evidence that indicates variable regulatory mechanisms through multilayered and cross-reacting pathways. Our analytical approach will add to enhancement of prevailing therapeutic interventions and bring to the forefront the significance of chemosensory modalities for the evaluation and maintenance of long-term health.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has caused more than 6.7 million tragic deaths, plus, a large percentage of people who survived it present a myriad of chronic symptoms that last for at least 6 months; this has been named as long COVID. Some of the most prevalent are painful symptoms like headache, joint pain, migraine, neuropathic-like pain, fatigue and myalgia. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate genes, and their involvement in several pathologies has been extensively shown. A deregulation of miRNAs has been observed in patients with COVID-19. The objective of the present systematic review was to show the prevalence of chronic pain-like symptoms of patients with long COVID and based on the expression of miRNAs in patients with COVID-19, and to present a proposal on how they may be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of chronic pain-like symptoms. A systematic review was carried out in online databases for original articles published between March 2020 to April 2022; the systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines, and it was registered in PROSPERO with registration number CRD42022318992. A total of 22 articles were included for the evaluation of miRNAs and 20 regarding long COVID; the overall prevalence of pain-like symptoms was around 10 to 87%, plus, the miRNAs that were commonly up and downregulated were miR-21-5p, miR-29a,b,c-3p miR-92a,b-3p, miR-92b-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-200a, c-3p, miR-320a,b,c,d,e-3p, and miR-451a. The molecular pathways that we hypothesized to be modulated by these miRNAs are the IL-6/STAT3 proinflammatory axis and the compromise of the blood-nerve barrier; these two mechanisms could be associated with the prevalence of fatigue and chronic pain in the long COVID population, plus they could be novel pharmacological targets in order to reduce and prevent these symptoms.",

Non-pharmacological treatments for these symptoms are poorly understood. This review summarises the evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for PVS. Methods:We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for PVS, as compared to either standard care, alternative non-pharmacological therapy, or placebo. The outcomes of interest were changes in symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life (including mental health and wellbeing), and work capability. We searched five databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, MedRxiv) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1 January 2001 to 29 October 2021. The relevant outcome data were extracted, the study quality was appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and the findings were synthesised narratively. Findings:Overall, five studies of five different interventions (Pilates, music therapy, telerehabilitation, resistance exercise, neuromodulation) met the inclusion criteria. Aside from music-based intervention, all other selected interventions demonstrated some support in the management of PVS in some patients. Interpretation:In this study, we observed a lack of robust evidence evaluating the non-pharmacological treatments for PVS, including Long COVID. Considering the prevalence of prolonged symptoms following acute viral infections, there is an urgent need for clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with PVS.

    "abstract": "GABA and GABAA-receptors (GABAA-Rs) play major roles in neurodevelopment and neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). There has been a growing appreciation that GABAA-Rs are also present on most immune cells. Studies in the fields of autoimmune disease, cancer, parasitology, and virology have observed that GABA-R ligands have anti-inflammatory actions on T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), while also enhancing regulatory T cell (Treg) responses and shifting APCs toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. These actions have enabled GABAA-R ligands to ameliorate autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis (MS), and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as type 2 diabetes (T2D)-associated inflammation in preclinical models. Conversely, antagonism of GABAA-R activity promotes the pro-inflammatory responses of T cells and APCs, enhancing anti-tumor responses and reducing tumor burden in models of solid tumors. Lung epithelial cells also express GABA-Rs, whose activation helps maintain fluid homeostasis and promote recovery from injury. The ability of GABAA-R agonists to limit both excessive immune responses and lung epithelial cell injury may underlie recent findings that GABAA-R agonists reduce the severity of disease in mice infected with highly lethal coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 and MHV-1). These observations suggest that GABAA-R agonists may provide off-the-shelf therapies for COVID-19 caused by new SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as novel beta-coronaviruses, which evade vaccine-induced immune responses and antiviral medications. We review these findings and further advance the notions that (1) immune cells possess GABAA-Rs to limit inflammation in the CNS, and (2) this natural \"braking system\" on inflammatory responses may be pharmacologically engaged to slow the progression of autoimmune diseases, reduce the severity of COVID-19, and perhaps limit neuroinflammation associated with long COVID.",

    "abstract": "Long-term neurological complications, persisting in patients who cannot fully recover several months after severe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, are referred to as neurological sequelae of the long COVID syndrome. Among the numerous clinical post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, neurological and psychiatric manifestations comprise prolonged fatigue, \"brain fog\", memory deficits, headache, ageusia, anosmia, myalgias, cognitive impairments, anxiety, and depression lasting several months. Considering that neurons are highly vulnerable to inflammatory and oxidative stress damages following the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), neuroinflammation and oxidative stress have been suggested to dominate the pathophysiological mechanisms of the long COVID syndrome. It is emphasized that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress damages are crucial for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, antioxidant therapies have the potential to slow down and prevent disease progression. However, many antioxidant compounds display low bioavailability, instability, and transport to targeted tissues, limiting their clinical applications. Various nanocarrier types, e.g., liposomes, cubosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, micelles, dendrimers, carbon-based nanostructures, nanoceria, and other inorganic nanoparticles, can be employed to enhance antioxidant bioavailability. Here, we highlight the potential of phytochemical antioxidants and other neuroprotective agents (curcumin, quercetin, vitamins C, E and D, melatonin, rosmarinic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and Ginkgo Biloba derivatives) in therapeutic strategies for neuroregeneration. A particular focus is given to the beneficial role of nanoparticle-mediated drug-delivery systems in addressing the challenges of antioxidants for managing and preventing neurological disorders as factors of long COVID sequelae.",

    "abstract": "The role of hypoxia, vascular endothelial injury, and thrombotic inflammation in worsening COVID-19 symptoms has been generally recognized. Damaged vascular endothelium plays a crucial role in formingin situthrombosis, pulmonary dysfunction, and hypoxemia. Thrombotic inflammation can further aggravate local vascular endothelial injury and affect ventilation and blood flow ratio. According to the results of many studies, obesity is an independent risk factor for a variety of severe respiratory diseases and contributes to high mechanical ventilation rate, high mortality, and slow recovery in COVID-19 patients. This review will explore the mechanisms by which obesity may aggravate the acute phase of COVID-19 and delay long COVID recovery by affecting hypoxia, vascular endothelial injury, and thrombotic inflammation. A systematic search of PubMed database was conducted for papers published since January 2020, using the medical subject headings of \"COVID-19\" and \"long COVID\" combined with the following keywords: \"obesity,\" \"thrombosis,\" \"endothelial injury,\" \"inflammation,\" \"hypoxia,\" \"treatment,\" and \"anticoagulation.\" In patients with obesity, the accumulation of central fat restricts the expansion of alveoli, exacerbating the pulmonary dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 invasion, inflammatory damage, and lung edema. Abnormal fat secretion and immune impairment further aggravate the original tissue damage and inflammation diffusion. Obesity weakens baseline vascular endothelium function leading to an early injury and pre-thrombotic state after infection. Enhanced procoagulant activity and microthrombi promote early obstruction of the vascular. Obesity also prolongs the duration of symptoms and increases the risk of sequelae after hospital discharge. Persistent viral presence, long-term inflammation, microclots, and hypoxia may contribute to the development of persistent symptoms, suggesting that patients with obesity are uniquely susceptible to long COVID. Early interventions, including supplemental oxygen, comprehensive antithrombotic therapy, and anti-inflammatory drugs, show effectiveness in many studies in the prevention of serious hypoxia, thromboembolic events, and systemic inflammation, and are therefore recommended to reduce intensive care unit admission, mortality, and sequelae.",

This phenomenon, termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID, is associated with high viral titers during acute infection, a persistently hyperactivated immune system, tissue injury by NETosis-induced micro-thrombofibrosis (NETinjury), microbial translocation, complement deposition, fibrotic macrophages, the presence of autoantibodies, and lymphopenic immune environments.

Specifically, we focus on data supporting common immunopathogenesis and tissue injury mechanisms shared across this highly heterogenous disorder, including NETosis, coagulopathy, and fibrosis. Mechanisms include changes in leukocyte subsets/functions, fibroblast activation, cytokine imbalances, lower cortisol, autoantibodies, co-pathogen reactivation, and residual immune activation driven by persistent viral antigens and/or microbial translocation. Taken together, we develop the premise that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in PASC as a consequence of acute and/or persistent single or multiple organ injury mediated by PASC determinants to include the degree of host responses (inflammation, NETinjury), residual viral antigen (persistent antigen), and exogenous factors (microbial translocation). Determinants of PASC may be amplified by comorbidities, age, and sex.",

Results:We found 15 articles representing 12 studies out of 619 citations from different sources. These studies provided 133 findings that were categorized into 55 categories. All categories were aggregated to the following synthesized findings: living with complex physical health problems, psychosocial crises of long COVID, slow recovery and rehabilitation, digital resources and information management, changes in social support, and experiences with healthcare providers, services, and systems. Ten studies were from the UK, and others were from Denmark and Italy, which highlights a critical lack of evidence from other countries. Conclusions:More representative research is needed to understand long COVID-related experiences from diverse communities and populations. The available evidence informs a high burden of biopsychosocial challenges among people with long COVID that would require multilevel interventions such as strengthening health and social policies and services, engaging patients and caregivers in making decisions and developing resources, and addressing health and socioeconomic disparities associated with long COVID through evidence-based practice.",

The presentation of COVID-19 is more severe in persons with underlying medical conditions such as Tuberculosis (TB), Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and other pneumonic conditions. All three diseases are of global concern and can significantly affect the lungs with characteristic cytokine storm, immunosuppression, and respiratory failure. Co-infections of SARS-CoV-2 with HIV andMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) have been reported, which may influence their pathogenesis and disease progression. Pulmonary TB and HIV/AIDS patients could be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to lethal synergy and disease severity. Therefore, the biological and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, and TB need to be understood holistically. While data is needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these existing diseases, it is necessary to review the implications of the evolving COVID-19 management on HIV/AIDS and TB control, including therapy and funding. Also, the impact of long COVID on patients, who may have this co-infection. Thus, this review highlights the implications of COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, and TB co-infection compares disease mechanisms, addresses growing concerns, and suggests a direction for improved diagnosis and general management.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between COVID-19 vaccination and long COVID. Methods:PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched on September 2022 without language restrictions (CRD42022360399) to identify prospective trials and observational studies comparing patients with and without vaccination before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We also included studies reporting symptomatic changes of ongoing long COVID following vaccination among those with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Odds ratios (ORs) for each outcome were synthesized using a random-effects model. Symptomatic changes after vaccination were synthesized by a one-group meta-analysis. Results:Six observational studies involving 536,291 unvaccinated and 84,603 vaccinated (before SARS-CoV-2 infection) patients (mean age, 41.2-66.6; female, 9.0-67.3%) and six observational studies involving 8,199 long COVID patients (mean age, 40.0 to 53.5; female, 22.2-85.9%) who received vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Two-dose vaccination was associated with a lower risk of long COVID compared to no vaccination (OR, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.92) and one-dose vaccination (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83). Two-dose vaccination compared to no vaccination was associated with a lower risk of persistent fatigue (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.93) and pulmonary disorder (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.47-0.52). Among those with ongoing long COVID symptoms, 54.4% (95% CI, 34.3-73.1%) did not report symptomatic changes following vaccination, while 20.3% (95% CI, 8.1-42.4%) experienced symptomatic improvement after two weeks to six months of COVID-19 vaccination.

This scoping review yielded 11 articles based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Except for one, all studies suggested an increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus 4 weeks after acute infection. This risk appears most in the first six months after the acute COVID-19 infection and seems to increase in a graded fashion based on the severity of the initial COVID-19 infection. Our review suggests a possible association of new-onset diabetes mellitus 4 weeks after acute COVID-19 infection. Since the severity of COVID-19 infection is associated with the development of post-infectious diabetes, vaccination that reduces the severity of acute COVID-19 infection might help to reduce the risk of post-COVID-19 diabetes mellitus. More studies are needed to better understand and quantify the association of post-COVID-19 conditions with diabetes and the role of vaccination in influencing it.",

    "abstract": "Statistics Canada estimated that approximately 1.4 million Canadians suffer from long COVID. Although cardiovascular changes during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are well documented, long-term cardiovascular sequelae are less understood. In this review, we sought to characterize adult cardiovascular outcomes in the months after acute COVID-19 illness. In our search we identified reports of outcomes including cardiac dysautonomia, myocarditis, ischemic injuries, and ventricular dysfunction. Even in patients without overt cardiac outcomes, subclinical changes have been observed. Cardiovascular sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection can stem from exacerbation of preexisting conditions, ongoing inflammation, or as a result of damage that occurred during acute infection. For example, myocardial fibrosis has been reported months after hospital admission for COVID-19 illness, and might be a consequence of myocarditis and myocardial injury during acute disease. In turn, myocardial fibrosis can contribute to further outcomes including dysrhythmias and heart failure. Severity of acute infection might be a risk factor for long-term cardiovascular consequences, however, cardiovascular changes have also been reported in young, healthy individuals who had asymptomatic or mild acute disease. Although evolving evidence suggests that previous SARS-CoV-2 infection might be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, there is heterogeneity in existing evidence, and some studies are marred by measured and unmeasured confounders. Many investigations have also been limited by relatively short follow-up. Future studies should focus on longer term outcomes (beyond 1 year) and identifying the prevalence of outcomes in different populations on the basis of acute and long COVID disease severity.",

Blood biomarkers can be altered in long COVID patients; however, biomarkers associated with long COVID symptoms and their roles in disease progression remain undetermined. This study aims to systematically evaluate blood biomarkers that may act as indicators or therapeutic targets for long COVID. Methods:A systematic literature review in PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL was performed on 18 August 2022. The search keywords long COVID-19 symptoms and biomarkers were used to filter out the eligible studies, which were then carefully evaluated. Results:Identified from 28 studies and representing six biological classifications, 113 biomarkers were significantly associated with long COVID: (1) Cytokine/Chemokine (38, 33.6%); (2) Biochemical markers (24, 21.2%); (3) Vascular markers (20, 17.7%); (4) Neurological markers (6, 5.3%); (5) Acute phase protein (5, 4.4%); and (6) Others (20, 17.7%). Compared with healthy control or recovered patients without long COVID symptoms, 79 biomarkers were increased, 29 were decreased, and 5 required further determination in the long COVID patients. Of these, up-regulated Interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor alpha might serve as the potential diagnostic biomarkers for long COVID. Moreover, long COVID patients with neurological symptoms exhibited higher levels of neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein whereas those with pulmonary symptoms exhibited a higher level of transforming growth factor beta. Conclusion:Long COVID patients present elevated inflammatory biomarkers after initial infection. Our study found significant associations between specific biomarkers and long COVID symptoms. Further investigations are warranted to identify a core set of blood biomarkers that can be used to diagnose and manage long COVID patients in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), due to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, presents with an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of symptoms and signs. COVID-19 susceptibility and mortality show a significant sex imbalance, with men being more prone to infection and showing a higher rate of hospitalization and mortality than women. In particular, cardiovascular diseases (preexistent or arising upon infection) play a central role in COVID-19 outcomes, differently in men and women. This review will discuss the potential mechanisms accounting for sex/gender influence in vulnerability to COVID-19. Such variability can be ascribed to both sex-related biological factors and sex-related behavioural traits. Sex differences in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 involve the endothelial dysfunction, the innate immune system and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Furthermore, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is involved in disease pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 and it shows hormone-dependent actions. The incidence of myocardial injury during COVID-19 is sex-dependent, predominantly in association with a greater degree of inflammation and coagulation disorders among men. Its pathogenesis is not fully elucidated, but the main theories foresee a direct role for the ACE2 receptor, the hyperimmune response and the RAS imbalance, which may also lead to isolated presentation of COVID-19-mediated myopericarditis. Moreover, the latest evidence on cardiovascular diseases and their relationship with COVID-19 during pregnancy will be discussed. Finally, authors will analyse the prevalence of the long-covid syndrome between the two sexes and its impact on the quality of life and cardiovascular health.",

To date, the COVID-19 has infected more than 600 million people gloabally. As a growing number of patients recover from acute infections and are discharged from hospitals, the proportion of patients in the recovery period is gradually increasing. Many of these individuals have been reported to experience multiple symptoms during the convalescence, such as fatigue, dyspnea and pain which are designated as \"long-COVID\", \"post-COVID syndrome\" or \"recovery sequelae. We searched for recent articles published in PubMed on COVID-19 convalescence and found that the pathogenesis of COVID-19 convalescence is not yet well recognized. It may be associated with incomplete recovery of immune system, parenchymal organ damage (liver or lung), coagulation abnormalities, \"second hit\" caused by viral infection, and Phenomenon of Cell Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). Some drugs and psychological factors of patients also play a non-negligible role in it. We also found that the effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is effective in the treatment of the COVID-19 recovery phase, which can not only relieve the corresponding symptoms, but also improve the indicators and pulmonary fibrosis. Bufei Huoxue Capsule, as the only drug explicitly mentioned for COVID-19 recovery period, can exert strong rehabilitative effects on physiological activity in patients recovering from COVID-19. In addition, in previous studies, traditional Chinese medicine has been confirmed to have the ability to resist cytokine storms, as well as improve coagulation and myocardial damage, which makes it have potential therapeutic advantages in targeting the hyperimmune response, coagulation abnormalities and myocardial damage existing in the recovery period.

    "abstract": "Following an acute COVID-19 infection, a large number of patients experience persisting symptoms for more than four weeks, a condition now classified as Long-COVID syndrome. Interestingly, the likelihood and severity of Long-COVID symptoms do not appear to be related to the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection. Fatigue is amongst the most common and debilitating symptoms of Long-COVID. Other symptomes include dyspnoea, chest pain, olfactory disturbances, and brain fog. Fatigue is also frequently reported in many other neurological diseases, affecting a broad range of everyday activities. However, despite its clinical significance, limited progress has been made in understanding its causes and developing effective treatment options. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods offer the unique opportunity to modulate fatigue-related maladaptive neuronal activity. Recent data show promising results of NIBS applications over frontoparietal regions to reduce fatigue symptoms. In this current paper, we review recent data on Long-COVID and Long-COVID-related fatigue (LCOF), with a special focus on cognitive fatigue. We further present widely used NIBS methods, such as transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial alternating current stimulation, and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and propose their use as possible therapeutic strategies to alleviate individual pathomechanisms of LCOF. Since NIBS methods are safe and well-tolerated, they have the potential to enhance the quality of life in a broad group of patients.",

    "abstract": "In the beginning of COVID-19, the proportion of confirmed cases in the pediatric population was relatively small and there was an opinion that children often had a mild or asymptomatic course of infection. Our understanding of the immune response, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 is highly oriented towards the adult population. At the same time, despite the fact that COVID-19 in children usually occurs in a mild form, there is an incomplete understanding of the course as an acute infection and its subsequent manifestations such as Long-COVID-19 or Post-COVID-19, PASC in the pediatric population, correlations with comorbidities and immunological changes. In mild COVID-19 in childhood, some authors explain the absence of population decreasing T and B lymphocytes. Regardless of the patient's condition, they can have the second phase, related to the exacerbation of inflammation in the heart tissue even if the viral infection was completely eliminated-post infectious myocarditis. Mechanism of myocardial dysfunction development in MIS-C are not fully understood. It is known that various immunocompetent cells, including both resident inflammatory cells of peripheral tissues (for example macrophages, dendritic cells, resident memory T-lymphocytes and so on) and also circulating in the peripheral blood immune cells play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of myocarditis. It is expected that hyperproduction of interferons and the enhanced cytokine response of T cells 1 and 2 types contribute to dysfunction of the myocardium. However, the role of Th1 in the pathogenesis of myocarditis remains highly controversial. At the same time, the clinical manifestations and mechanisms of damage, including the heart, both against the background and after COVID-19, in children differ from adults. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether transient or persistent cardiac complications are associated with long-term adverse cardiac events.",

    "abstract": "Study objective: Long COVID patients can experience high levels of impairment in their cognitive function and mental health. Using a parallel randomized control trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neuro-meditation program to reduce cognitive impairment in patients with long COVID. Methods: A total of 34 patients with long COVID were randomized to an intervention group (G-Int; n = 17) or a control group (G-Con; n = 17) and 15 healthy participants were constitutive of a normative group (G-Nor). The intervention consisted of ten 30-min sessions of Rebalance® over a period of five weeks. Each session included sound therapy and coach-guided meditation associated with light stimulations (i.e., chromotherapy). Primary outcomes were performance on five computerized cognitive tasks (choice response time, pattern comparison, Simon, pursuit rotor task, and Corsi block-tapping task), mental and physical fatigue (Chalder fatigue scale), perceived stress (perceived stress scale) and mood (profiles of mood states). Secondary outcomes were anxiety and depressive symptoms (hospital anxiety and depression scale), muscular pain, joint pain, and headaches using visual analog scales (VAS) as well as sleep quality (Spiegel sleep questionnaire). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 1−2 and 7−8 days of follow-up. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, long COVID patients showed significant differences at baseline on all the self-report questionnaires, and a Rebalance® program improved all the subjective reports, as well as cognitive performances, especially on reaction time-based tasks. In particular, only the G-Int group revealed shortened reaction times in the choice reaction time (RTbaseline = 593 ± 121 ms vs. RTpost2 = 521 ± 86 ms, p < 0.001), Simon (RTbaseline = 539 ± 123 ms vs. RTpost2 = 494 ± 134 ms, p < 0.01), and pattern comparison tasks (RTbaseline = 1244 ± 315 ms vs. RTpost2 = 1079 ± 213 ms, p < 0.001). Conclusions) Initial evidence suggests that neuro-meditation reduces cognitive impairment and improves physical and mental fatigue, muscle and joint pain, symptoms of depression and anxiety, mood disturbances as well as sleep quality. The Rebalance® program hence constitutes a promising non-pharmacological intervention for the treatment of long-term psychological/cognitive outcomes of COVID-19.",

Common symptoms of PCC, that persists 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 are fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction. No effective treatment options have been widely adopted in clinical practice. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is a candidate drug. Methods:The objective of this interim analysis is to describe our cohort and evaluate the safety of HBO2for post covid condition. In an ongoing randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, clinical trial, 20 previously healthy subjects with PCC were assigned to HBO2or placebo. Primary endpoints are physical domains in RAND-36; Physical functioning (PF) and Role Physical (RP) at 13 weeks. Secondary endpoints include objective physical tests. Safety endpoints are occurrence, frequency, and seriousness of Adverse Events (AEs). An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed unblinded data. The trial complies with Good Clinical Practice. Safety endpoints are evaluated descriptively. Comparisons against norm data was done using t-test. Results:Twenty subjects were randomised, they had very low HRQoL compared to norm data. Mean (SD) PF 31.75 (19.55) (95% Confidence interval; 22.60-40.90) vs 83.5 (23.9) p < 0.001 in Rand-36 PF and mean 0.00 (0.00) in RP. Very low physical performance compared to norm data. 6MWT 442 (180) (95% CI 358-525) vs 662 (18) meters p < 0.001. 31 AEs occurred in 60% of subjects. In 20 AEs, there were at least a possible relationship with the study drug, most commonly cough and chest pain/discomfort.

    "abstract": "The German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) recently published its draft report to the government about myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The IQWiG concluded that graded exercise therapy (GET) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) should be recommended in the treatment for mild and moderate ME/CFS based on two CBT and two GET studies. In this article, we reviewed the evidence used by IQWiG to support their claims, because their conclusion is diametrically opposed to the conclusion by the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in its recently updated ME/CFS guidelines. Our analysis shows that the trials IQWiG used in support suffered from serious flaws, which included badly designed control groups; relying on subjective primary outcomes in non-blinded studies; alliance and response shift bias, including patients in their trials who did not have the disease under investigation, selective reporting, making extensive endpoint changes and low to very low adherence of treatments. Our analysis also shows that the report itself used one CBT and one GET study that both examined a different treatment. The report also used a definition of CBT that does not reflect the way it is being used in ME/CFS or was tested in the studies. The report noted that one study used a wrong definition of post-exertional malaise (PEM), the main characteristic of the disease, according to the report. Yet, it ignored the consequence of this, that less than the required minimum percentage of patients had the disease under investigation in that study. It also ignored the absence of improvement on most of the subjective outcomes, as well as the fact that the IQWiG methods handbook states that one should use objective outcomes and not rely on subjective outcomes in non-blinded studies. The report concluded that both treatments did not lead to objective improvement in the six-minute walk test but then ignored that. The report did not analyze the other objective outcomes of the studies (step test and occupational and benefits status), which showed a null effect. Finally, the report states that the studies do not report on safety yet assumes that the treatments are safe based on a tendency towards small subjective improvements in fatigue and physical functioning, even though the adherence to the treatments was (very) low and the studies included many patients who did not have the disease under investigation and, consequently, did not suffer from exertion intolerance contrary to ME/CFS patients. At the same time, it ignored and downplayed all the evidence that both treatments are not safe, even when the evidence was produced by a British university. In conclusion, the studies used by the report do not provide any evidence that CBT and GET are safe and effective. Consequently, the report and the studies do not provide any support for the recommendation to use CBT and GET for ME/CFS or long COVID, which, in many cases, is the same or resembles ME/CFS, after an infection with SARS-CoV-2.",
    "summary": "The German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) recently published its draft report to the government about myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Our analysis shows that the trials IQWiG used in support suffered from serious flaws, which included badly designed control groups; relying on subjective primary outcomes in non-blinded studies; alliance and response shift bias, including patients in their trials who did not have the disease under investigation, selective reporting, making extensive endpoint changes and low to very low adherence of treatments. The report noted that one study used a wrong definition of post-exertional malaise (PEM), the main characteristic of the disease, according to the report. At the same time, it ignored and downplayed all the evidence that both treatments are not safe, even when the evidence was produced by a British university. In conclusion, the studies used by the report do not provide any evidence that CBT and GET are safe and effective.",

    "abstract": "Background:Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is a well-recognized, complex, systemic disease which is associated with substantial morbidity. There is a paucity of established interventions for the treatment of patients with this syndrome. Objectives:To systematically review registered trials currently investigating therapeutic modalities for PACS. Data sources:A search was conducted up to the 16 September, 2022, using the COVID-19 section of the WHO Internal Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions:Interventional clinical trials of any sample size examining any therapeutic modality targeting persistent symptoms among individuals after diagnosis with COVID-19. Methods:Data on trial characteristics and intervention characteristics were collected and summarized. Results:After screening 17 125 trials, 388 trials, from 42 countries, were eligible. In total, we had 406 interventions, of which 368 were mono-therapeutic strategies, whereas 38 were intervention combinations. Among 824 primary outcomes identified, there were >300 different outcomes. Rehabilitation was the most employed class of intervention in 169 trials. We encountered 76 trials examining the pharmacological agents of various classes, with the most common agent being colchicine. Complementary and alternative medicine encompassed 64 trials exploring traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathic medications, naturopathic medications, vitamins, dietary supplements, and botanicals. Psychotherapeutic and educational interventions were also employed in 12 and 4 trials, respectively. Other interventions, including transcranial direct current stimulation, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation, general electrical stimulation, cranial electrotherapy stimulation, various stem cell interventions, and oxygen therapy interventions, were also employed. Conclusion:We identified 388 registered trials, with a high degree of heterogeneity, exploring 144 unique mono-therapeutic interventions for PACS. Most studies target general alleviation of symptoms. There is a need for further high-quality and methodologically robust PACS treatment trials to be conducted with standardization of outcomes while following WHO's recommendation for uniform evaluation and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background:As defined by the WHO, the term post-COVID syndrome (PCS) embraces a group of symptoms that can occur following the acute phase of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a consequence thereof. PCS is found mainly in adults, less frequently in children and adolescents. It can develop both in patients who initially had only mild symptoms or none at all and in those who had a severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods:The data presented here were derived from a systematic literature review. Results:PCS occurs in up to 15% of unvaccinated adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. The prevalence has decreased in the most recent phase of the pandemic and is lower after vaccination. The pathogenesis of PCS has not yet been fully elucidated. Virustriggered inflammation, autoimmunity, endothelial damage (to blood vessels), and persistence of virus are thought to be causative. Owing to the broad viral tropism, different organs are involved and the symptoms vary. To date, there are hardly any evidence-based recommendations for definitive diagnosis of PCS or its treatment. Conclusion:The gaps in our knowledge mean that better documentation of the prevalence of PCS is necessary to compile the data on which early detection, diagnosis, and treatment can be based. To ensure the best possible care of patients with PCS, regional PCS centers and networks embracing existing structures from all healthcare system sectors and providers should be set up and structured diagnosis and treatment algorithms should be established. Given the sometimes serious consequences of PCS for those affected, it seems advisable to keep the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections low by protective measures tailored to the prevailing pandemic situation.",
